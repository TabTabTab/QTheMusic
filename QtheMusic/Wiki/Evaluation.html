<h1>QTheMusic</h1>
<p>
All in all we succeeded with our vision. The original idea of QTM was to create a simple application which made it possible to collaborate in 
order to create a playlist.
We had hopes of creating a service usable outside of a local network without letting all communication between the User Host and the User Client go 
through the Central Server. We did not have time to implement this functionality and if we were to rewrite the project we might have let all 
communication go through the Central Server. The reason for not doing this in the first time was that we did not want to burden the Central Server
with too much unnecessary traffic. 
</br>
One of the hardest part of the project was also one of the most interesting. This was making sure that the visual representation of the queue was 
across all connected parties. Another challenge was researching how to let a User Client and a User Host communicate without the central server.
