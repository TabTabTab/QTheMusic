<h1>QTheMusic</h1>

	<h2>Abstract Description</h2>
		<p><i>
			The QTheMusic project is an attempt to revolutionize the average play list, making it interactive 
			in a way that lets multiple devices contribute to the order in which the tracks are played.
		</i></p>

	<h2>Entity Description</h2>
		<p><i>
			The intended finished product essentially consists of three entities: A central server, 
			a host application and a client application. The communication between the three entities 
			happens over the internet using the TCP protocol.
		</i></p>
	
		<h3><i>The Central Server</i></h3>
			<p>
				<i>The Central Server</i> essentially serves as a lookup table or a DNS server.
				A host may register itself at the central server which makes a client able to find
				its address and port which is open to clients. 
				A host will then remain connected to the central server until it is no longer hosting.
			</p>
		<h3><i>The Host</i></h3>
			<p>
				<i>The Host</i> has list of tracks which it makes available to all its clients.
				The clients connected to the host may then choose which tracks should be played by the host.
				This is done using a queue, each client may add tracks to the queue.
				Multiple clients may be connected to the host at a time.
				<i>The Host</i> needs to register and stay connected to <i>The Central Server</i> in order for it to act as a host.
			</p>
		<h3><i>The Client</i></h3>
			<p>
				<i>The Client</i> connects to a host in order to partake in the creation of the music queue.
				<i>The Client</i> can then choose what tracks will be played by the host by adding them to <i>The Host</i>s queue.
